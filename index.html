          <p class="summery"> 
            <b> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</b> <br> HTML constitutes the nuts and bolts of any website content. This is the most basic skill that every front-end developer you hire must have at their fingertips.
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This is the language to determine how to present the content on the foundation built with HTML. CSS determines the style of the website – its animations, color, fonts, layout, etc. <br>
            <b>Javascript/Jquery:</b> <br> This is what makes websites interactive. Javascript (JS) is the programming language that determines how a website functions. Jquery is a library of addons and plugins that compress some common functions requiring multiple JS scripts into a single line. <br>
            <b>CSS and Javascript Frameworks:</b> <br> These frameworks contain an assortment of CSS and JS files that provide a common framework for a number of tasks. The option of using both of them together extends the range of multifunctionality.
            The CSS Bootstrap, for example, handles the look and feel of a website while Angularjs determines the content.
            Frameworks have their pros and cons like everything else. If you hire a front-end developer, he needs to know which frameworks to use for what kind of website.
            In-depth knowledge of CSS and JS frameworks is also essential for the efficient responsiveness of websites. <br>
            <b>Command Line:</b> <br> Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) are essential as they facilitate pointing and clicking on an interactive menu. However, sometimes it becomes necessary to key in commands for something specific. Front-end developers need to have this command line skill in addition to their mastery over GUIs.

          <h2>2020 | 2021</h2>
          <p class="summery">Simply put, full stack developer is a kind of people who master a variety of skills and use these skills to complete a product independently. A top voted answer on Quora explained that what is a full stack developer:
            A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients.
            Depending on the project, what customers need may be a mobile stack, a Web stack, or a native application stack.
            In fact, “full stack” refers to the collection of a series of technologies needed to complete a project. “Stack” refers to a collection of sub-modules. These software sub-modules or components combined together to achieve the established function while without the need for other modules.</p>

<h3 class="hi">Frontend Developer</h3>
<h2>2021 | 2022</h2>
<p class="summery">Front-end technologies are becoming more and more important in today’s project and product development. In addition to product features, the user experience is also one of the criteria to test the success of a product. All that depends on the implementation of the front-end technology, soyou need to master some basic front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and further study the front-end frameworks or third-party libraries such as JQuery, LESS, SASS, AngularJS, or REACT.</p>
